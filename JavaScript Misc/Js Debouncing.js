//Javascript Debouncing
/*
Debouncing is a method used in JavaScript to increase browser performance.
There may be some features on a web page that needs time-consuming computations.
If such type of method is applied frequently, it may greatly affect the browser's performance because Javascript is a single-threaded language.
Debouncing is a programming technique that assures that time-consuming activities do not trigger the web page's performance decreases.
In other words, the Debounce methods do not run when invoked. Instead, they wait a predetermined period of time until executing.
When we call the same process again, the previous process is canceled, and the timer is reset.
