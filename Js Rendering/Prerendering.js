//What is Pre-rendering...
/*
Pre-rendering is a tradeoff between client-side and server-side rendering.
Every pre-rendered page displays a skeleton template while the data waits to be reHydrated with AJAX/XHR requests.
Once the page is fetched, internal routing is done dynamically to take advantage of a client-side rendered website.
